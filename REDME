Multi-Modal Sentiment Analyzer (Full Stack)
This project is a full-stack web application that performs sentiment analysis on text, facial expressions, and sign language.

Project Structure
/frontend: Contains all the client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This is what the user sees and interacts with.

/backend: Contains the server-side Python code. It uses the Flask framework to create an API that the frontend communicates with to perform complex tasks.

How to Run the Project
1. Backend Setup (Python)
First, you need to set up and run the backend server.

Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the server:

python app.py

The backend server will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Frontend Setup
There is no complex setup for the frontend. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Navigate to the frontend folder and open the file:

/frontend/index.html

The application should now be fully functional. You can create an account, log in, and use all the analysis features, which are now powered by your Python backend.

Note on Java: While this project uses a Python backend for simplicity and its strong AI/ML libraries, a Java backend could also be used, especially for the authentication part. In a microservices architecture, you could have a Java service (using a framework like Spring Boot) handle user management and a Python service for the AI tasks. For this project, I've consolidated everything into Python to make it easier to run.
